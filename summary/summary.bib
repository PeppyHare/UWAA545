abstract = {The Dory–Guest–Harris instability is demonstrated to be a well-suited benchmark for continuum kinetic Vlasov–Poisson algorithms. The instability is a special case of perpendicularly-propagating kinetic electrostatic waves in a warm uniformly magnetized plasma. A complete derivation of the closed-form linear theory dispersion relation for the instability is presented. The electric field growth rates and oscillation frequencies specified by the dispersion relation provide concrete measures against which simulation results can be quantitatively compared. A fourth-order continuum kinetic algorithm is benchmarked against the instability, and is demonstrated to have good convergence properties and close agreement with theoretical growth rate and oscillation frequency predictions. Second-order accurate simulations are also shown to be consistent with theoretical predictions, but require higher resolution for convergence. The Dory–Guest–Harris instability benchmark extends the scope of current standard test problems by providing a substantive means of validating continuum kinetic simulations of magnetized plasmas in higher-dimensional 3D (x,vx,vy) phase space. The linear theory analysis, initial conditions, algorithm description, and comparisons between theoretical predictions and simulation results are presented.},

abstract = {Recently, upwind differencing schemes have become very popular for solving hyperbolic partial differential equations, especially when discontinuities exist in the solutions. Among many upwind schemes successfully applied to the problems in gas dynamics, Roe's method stands out for its relative simplicity and clarity of the underlying physical model. In this paper, an upwind differencing scheme of Roe-type for the MHD equations is constructed. In each computational cell, the problem is first linearized around some averaged state which preserves the flux differences. Then the solution is advanced in time by computing the wave contributions to the flux at the cell interfaces. One crucial task of the linearization procedure is the construction of a Roe matrix. For the special case γ = 2, a Roe matrix in the form of a mean value Jacobian is found, and for the general case, a simple averaging procedure is introduced. All other necessary ingredients of the construction, which include eigenvalues, and a complete set of right eigenvectors of the Roe matrix and decomposition coefficients are presented. As a numerical example, we chose a coplanar MHD Riemann problem. The problem is solved by the newly constructed second-order upwind scheme as well as by the Lax-Friedrichs, the Lax-Wendroff, and the flux-corrected transport schemes. The results demonstrate several advantages of the upwind scheme. In this paper, we also show that the MHD equations are nonconvex. This is a contrast to the general belief that the fast and slow waves are like sound waves in the Euler equations. As a consequence, the wave structure becomes more complicated; for example, compound waves consisting of a shock and attached to it a rarefaction wave of the same family can exist in MHD.}
